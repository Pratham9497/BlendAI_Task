This is not a complete stock monitoring app. I have only made the backend APIs (inside stock_monitoring_platform directory) using Django because I am having exams these days. If the deadline could be extended to 25th May, I would be able to provide the complete web app.

To use the APIs simply clone the repository in local machine and type python manage.py runserver to host the API locally.
